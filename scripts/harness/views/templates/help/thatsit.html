<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

<p>That's all the tech demonstrator can show for now. The PSOM algorithm implemented here is complete but requires more example data sets to show it learning new classes, filtering noise and detecting novelty.</p>

<p>The harness itself is a framework designed to host any number of algorithms, sources or sinks. I plan to implement the other networks from my PhD thesis, the Extended PSOM (like the PSOM but better) and the Temporal PSOM (dynamically builds Markov chains). I also want live data sources and side-by-side comparisons with other networks.</p>
