<p>Welcome to Rob Lang's Artificial Intelligence Harness, a playground to experiment with dynamic neural networks.</p>
<p>This tech demo will show the Plastic Self Organising Map dynamic neural network learning by growing to accommodate three classes.</p>
<p>Dynamic neural networks (DNN) grow to learn new classes and shrink to forget noise and lost classes. Unlike other other neural networks (MLP, SOM), DNNs operate on nonstationary streams of data where classes can appear and disappear after training has begun.</p>
